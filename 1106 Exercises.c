True or False.

A) The impressive functions performed by computers essentially involve the manipulation of zeros and ones.
TRUE.

B) People prefer to manimpuate bits instead of characters and fileds because bits are more compact.
FALSE.  WTF

C) People specify programs and data items as characters; computers then manipulate and process these characters as groups of zeros and ones.
TRUE.

D) A person's zip code is an example of a numeric field.
FALSE.  This is true in the United States, but many other places have letters in their zip code.

E) Data items processed by a computer form a data hierarchy in which data items become larger and more complex as we progress from fields to characters to bits, and so on.
TRUE.

F) A record key identifies a record as belonging to a particular field.
TRUE.  if the term is used casually.  A better terms would be file control block or even fild descriptor, but it could be argued that these are record keys.  The word key has a flexible meaning.

G) Most companies store their information in a single file to facilitate computer processing.
FALSE.  This question relies too heavily on opinion.  Anyway, it is faster to access only the type of information you need.  I wouldn't open the entire internet just so I could search for a an email address I once saved.

H) Files are always referred to by name in C programs.
FALSE.  or true depending on the meaning.  The question is badly written.  Usually a pointer performs the needed functionality in a program, but if that is thought of as a completely seperate action, then this is true.

I) When a program creates a file, the file is automatically retained by the computer for future reference.
TRUE.  Although I feel like the meaning is again not clear enough.  When a file is opened, it remains opened until the code directs it to be closed or the program ends.  Does future reference mean after the program ends or while the code is running?
