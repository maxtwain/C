A) A structure is a collection of related variables under one name.
B) A union is a collection of variables under one name in which the variables share the same storage.
C) The bits in the result of an expression using the & operator are set to 1 if the corresponding bits in each operand are set to 1.  Otherwise the bits are set to zero.
D) The variables declared in a sturcture definition are called its members.
E) In an expression using the | operator, bits are set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits in either operand is set to 1.  Otherwise, the bits are set to zero.
F) Keyword struct introduces a structure declaration.
G) Keyword typedef is used to create a synonym for a previously defined data type.
H) In an expression using the ^ operator, bits are set to 1 if exactly one of the corresponding bits in either operand is set to 1.  Otherwise, the bits are set to zero.
I) The bitwise AND operator (&) is often used to mask bits - that is to select certain bits while zeroing others.
J) Keyword union is used to introduce a union definition.
K) The name of the structure is referred to as the structure tag name.
L) A structure member is accessed with either the dot operator (.) or the arrow operator (->).
M) The left shift (<<) and right shift (>>) operators are used to shift the bits of a value to the left or to the right respectively.
N) An enumeration is a set of integers represented by identifiers.
