What are the differences between a stack and a queue?

Both a stack and a queue are constrained link lists.  The difference between them is that while in a stack elements may be inserted and deleted at the top of the stack, a queue requires elements to be inserted on one end and deleted from the other.  A stack is a LIFO data structure, while a queue is a FIFO data structure.
