A) All input and output is dealt with in the form of STREAMS.
B) The STARNDARD INPUT stream is normally connected to the keyboard.
C) The STANDARD OUTPUT stream is normally connected to the computer screen.
D) Precise output formatting is accomplished with the PRINTF function.
E) The format control string may contain CONVERSION SPECIFIERS, FLAGS, FIELD WIDTHS, PRECISIONS, and LITERAL CHARACTERS.
F) The conversion specifier d or i may be used to output a signed decimal integer.
G) The conversion specifiers o, u, x are used to display unsigned integers in octal, decimal, and hexadecimal form, respectively.
H) The modifiers h and l are placed before the integer conversion specifiers to indicate that short or long integer values are to be displayed.
I) The conversion specifier e is used to display a floating point value in exponential notation.
J) The modifier l is placed before any floating point conversion specifier to indicate that a long double value is to be displayed.
K) The conversion specifiers e, E, and f are displayed with SIX digits of percision to the right of the decimal point if no precision is specified.
L) The conversion specifiers s and c are used to print strings and characters, respectively.
M) All strings end in the '\0' character.
N) The field width and precision in a printf conversion specifier can be controlled with integer expressions by substituting a(n) * for the field width or for the precision and placing an integer expression in the corresponding argument of the argument list.
O) The - flag causes output to be left justified in a field.
P) The + flag causes values to be displayed with either a plus sign or a minus sign.
Q) Precise input formatting is accomplished with the scanf function.
R) A(n) SCAN SET is used to scan a string for specific characters and store the characters in an array.
S) The conversion specifier i can be used to input optionally signed octal, decimal, and hexadecimal integers.
T) The conversion specifiers e, E, f, g, or G can be used to input a double value.
U) The * is used to read data from the input stream and discard it without assigning it to a variable.
V) A(n) FIELD WIDTH can be used in a scanf conversion specifier to indicate that a specific number of characters or digits should be read from the input stream.
