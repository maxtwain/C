A) A self-referential structure is used to form dynamic data structures.

B) Function malloc is used to dynamically allocate memory.

C) A stack is a specialized version of a linked list in which nodes can be inserted and deleted only from the start of the list.

D) Functions that look at a linked list but do not modify it are referred to as predicate.

E) A queue is referred to as a FIFO data structure.

F) The pointer to the next node in a linked list is referred to as a link.

G) Function free is used to reclaim dynamically allocated memory.

H) A _ is a specialized version of a linked list in which nodes can be inserted only at the start of the list and deleted only from the end of the list.
The book answer for this is queue, but there must be a typo.  Queues are removed from the head, inserted at the tail.

I) A tree is a nonlinear, two dimentional data structure that contains nodes with two or more links.

J) A stack is referred to as a LIFO data structure because the last node inserted is the first node removed.

K) The nodes of a binary tree contain two link members.

L) The first node of a tree is the root node.

M) Each link in a tree node points to a child or subtree of that node.

N) A tree node that has no children is called a leaf node.

O) The three traversal algorithms (covered in this chapter) for a binary tree are in-order, pre-order, post-order.
