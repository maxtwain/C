// This exercise asks to combine the shuffle function with the deal function, which would mean that the deck is shuffled every time one hand is dealt.  This makes no sense.  What sense is there in having a draw deck at all if it doesn't matter what cards exist in it beyond the first five?  If this five card deck is the strategy taken for a poker game, why not just randomize the cards strait into one hand?  It would be far simpiler to write every piece of the game if no draw deck truly exists.
